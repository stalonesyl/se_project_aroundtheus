**Intro**
  
I created a responsive webpage titled "Around the US" for my portfolio. It includes semantic HTML elements, CSS styles for an engaging user interface, and a profile section with interactivity.

The webpage features a header with a logo, a list of cards showcasing different locations, and a footer with copyright information. Overall, this project showcases my skills in creating a responsive and visually appealing webpage, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
